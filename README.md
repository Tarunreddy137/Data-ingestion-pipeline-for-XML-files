# Data-ingestion-pipeline-for-XML-files
## Overview
This project defines a pipeline for ingesting unstructured or semi-structured data from XML files and transforming it into a clean, structured tabular format. The pipeline covers XML parsing, data transformation, validation, preprocessing, metric logging, and structured output generation.
## Data Ingestion Layer (XML Input)
The ingestion layer is responsible for parsing raw XML data and extracting meaningful elements and attributes to build a structured dataset.
### Key Steps:
	Load XML files from local directory, API response, or cloud storage.
	Parse XML content using libraries such as:
		xml.etree.ElementTree
		lxml
		xmltodict
	Traverse the XML tree to:
		Extract elements, nested nodes, attributes, and values
		Handle hierarchical or repeated nodes (e.g., list of transactions, items)
	Flatten the hierarchical structure into rows and columns suitable for tabular formats
	Build a structured representation (e.g., pandas DataFrame)
	Validate extracted data for missing or malformed entries
	Log source metadata and ingestion status
### Supported Input:
	.xml files (with standard or custom tags)
	API/XML web services
	Nested or flattened XML schema
